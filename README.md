# javascript_game_project
This code is part of an Express.js application that handles various HTTP routes and sessions. It includes functionalities for session management, cookie handling, and basic user interaction.

- **Home Route (`/`):** Checks if the user is banned based on a session variable and renders the home page.
- **Read Route (`/read`):** Logs a message depending on whether the user is banned or not.
- **Cookie Management:**
  - `/cookiecreate`: Creates a cookie with a key-value pair (e.g., `Age: 25`).
  - `/cookieread`: Reads and logs the value of the cookie.
  - `/delete`: Clears the specified cookie.

The commented-out section shows a potential user creation route that interacts with a user model, but it's currently inactive.

### Suggested Name for the Repository:
